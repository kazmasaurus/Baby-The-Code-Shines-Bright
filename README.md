# About this TextMate theme

The bright pastel color palette is inspired by the lolita dresses of Baby, The Stars Shine Bright.

The selectors are based on the "Twilight" theme. The font is Monaco 12 pt. And it's going to make your code look really, really cute.

## This Fork

My collection of changes I've made over the years.

- Some color tweakes based on personal preferences.
- Adds styling for `storage.modifier` so it works a little better in strongly typed languages (I started using this theme when I was still writing Java for school!).
- Changing empty dicts from `<dict/>` to `<dict></dict>` because Sublime Text (2?) was choking on the former.
- Adding some styles for SublimeLinter. IIRC, these are pretty gross. I just threw them in there to get the job done.
